After you create a course, you can access information about it from the
Instructor Dashboard. You can find:

* Identifying information for the course.

* Whether the course has started or ended.

* The defined grade cutoff for passing or failing.

To view course data:

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Click **Instructor** then **Try New Beta Dashboard**.

#. Click **Course Info** if necessary. 

   The Basic Course Information section of the page that opens lists
   information for the course.

   In the **Basic Course Information** section of the page, the labels that
   the LMS uses for information about your course are slightly different than
   the labels that display in Studio when you create your course.
